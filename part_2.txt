Let's define the following:
N(A,A) = number of orders in city A taken drivers that reside in city A
N(B,B) = number of orders in city B taken drivers that reside in city B
N(A,B) = number of orders in city A taken drivers that reside in city B
N(B,A) = number of orders in city B taken drivers that reside in city A

so that:
N_same  = N(A,A) + N(B,B)
N_cross = N(A,B) + N(B,A)

The key measure of success would be N_cross >= N_same.
When it's equal it means there's no preference for drivers to operate in city A or B.

Experiment to measure that metric:

N(A) = number of orders in city A = N(A,A) + N(A,B), and vice versa for city B
N    = total orders = N(A) + N(B)

I distribute a fraction of N(A)/N orders to drivers A, and vice versa for B. And, I randomly select N for N(A) and N(B). In other words, the probability of an order is given to driver A or B depends on the ratio of order N(A) over total order N.

Then, I count N_same and N_cross. A success means N_cross > N_same.
To prove the significance, I run t-test between N_same and N_cross.
If p-value < 2.5% (two-tail test) then N_cross > N_same is real and we achieve our success.

Recommendation to city: use flat daily or monthly fee for toll bridge, rather than pay per cross.

Caveat in that experiment: there could be cancellation by passenger for N_cross because of long waiting time and the order ends up in N_same. If there are data that record this event, then this order need to be removed when making the clean data set.
